# Services and Dependency Injection

<hr>

**The Goal:** Add CRUD functionality to the application using services & dependency injection.

**What is CRUD?**
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
These are standard functions that web apps should have. 
Think of things like social media. You can create a profile, create posts, read other people's post, update your posts, and delete them. Thinking of these four things while looking at other applications can help you understand CRUD.

**Services:** 
**What are Services?**
Services are a way to take some weight off a component's back. Components should be used to present and bind data as a mediator between the logic of the app and the template. Services should handle tasks like fetching data, validating inputs from the user, etc.

**With Services We Will:**
 - We will change the way we store and fetch data
 - We will allow users to add books from the library to their bookshelf as well as remove books from their bookshelf.

<hr>

**Dependency Injection**
**What is Dependency Injection?**
Dependency injection is what we will be using in the components to access the service's methods. We inject the service into the component, so that all the functions we have in the service are accessable and executable.

# Step 1

<hr>

### Adding the Services

- Place services in corresponding folders. BookshelfService will go in the bookshelf folder. LibraryService will go in the library folder.

- A service exports a class with the typical Angular naming conventions.
```typescript
export class BookshelfService { }
```

- So we can use these services across the entire app we have to add a decorator called "@Injectable"
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'

@Injectable ({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class BookshelfService { }
```

- Providing the service in root provides it in the app module, or across the whole app

### Storing Data in Services

**bookshelfService**
- Currently the data we have is stored in the component. How do we store it in the service?

- We are simply going to move the data within the myBooks array to the service.

- Leave the myBooks array in the component empty.

- In the component we will be using **Dependency Injection** to access our new service.
```typescript
import { BookshelfService } from '../bookshelf.service'

export class BookListComponent {
  constructor(private bookshelfService: BookshelfService) {}
}
```

- We have data stored in the service now. How do we access this data from the service when the page loads?

book-list.component.ts
```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import { BookshelfService } from '../bookshelf.service'

export class BookListComponent implements OnInit{
  @Input() myBooks: Book[]
  @Input() book: Book

  constructor(private bookshelfService: BookshelfService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.myBooks = this.bookshelfService.getBooks()
  }
}
```

bookshelf.service.ts
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'

@Injectable ({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class BookshelfService { 
  private myBooks: Book[] = [
    ...
  ];

  getBooks() {
    return this.myBooks;
  }
}
```

- This is telling angular that when the BookListComponent is initialized, to get the data from the service and place it in the myBooks array in the component.

- We are ow going to get rid of all outputting event emitters in the BookComponent and the BookListComponent

- Add bookSelected EventEmitter to bookshelfService to listen for the selection of a book
```typescript
  import { EventEmitter } from '@angular/core'

  export class BookshelfService {
    bookSelected = new EventEmitter<Book>()
    ...
  }
```
- In the book.component.ts, book-list.component.ts get rid of outputting event emitters.

- Now we will inject the bookshelfService into the BookComponent

- Then we will change the onSelected() to refer to the bookshelfService's event emitter
  ```typescript
  onSelected() {
    this.bookshelfService.bookSelected.emit(this.book)
  }
  ```
- Remove the event listeners from all corresponding html files.
  
- Remove the onBookSelected method from the book-list section.
  
-  Inject bookshelfServie into the BookshelfComponent
1.  In the ngOnInit method add the bookSelected subscription.
```typescript
  export class BookshelfComponent implements OnInit {
    selectedBook: Book

    constructor(private bookshelfService: BookshelfService) {}

    ngOnInit(): void {
      this.bookshelfService.bookSelected
        .subscribe(
          (book: Book) => {
            this.selectedBook = book
          }
        )
    }
  }
```
- This should result in the same actions as before, just correctly storing and fetching data using a service.

**libraryService**
- To make the library service functional, we will start by moving hard coded data to the service.

- We will then make sure we add the import for the Book model

- Next we will add a getBooks method to retrieve the books for the library
  ```typescript
  import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
  import { Book } from "../shared/book/book.model";

  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
  })
  export class LibraryService {

    allBooks: Book[] = [
      new Book(
        'Testing API Books 2',
        'Bill',
        'Science',
        'https://source.unsplash.com/50x50/?science,book'
      ),
      new Book(
        'Library Test',
        'Rando',
        'Non-Fiction',
        'https://source.unsplash.com/50x50/?fantasy,book'
      ),
      new Book(
        'Book of API',
        'Will Wilder',
        'Mystery',
        'https://source.unsplash.com/50x50/?mystery,book'
      ),
    ];

    getBooks() {
      return this.allBooks.slice()
    }
  }
  ```

- Next we will add an input for all books in BookResultsComponent

- We will then need to inject the LibraryService

- Last we will make the call for getting the books on the initialization of the component
```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Book } from 'src/app/shared/book/book.model';
import { LibraryService } from '../library.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-book-results',
  templateUrl: './book-results.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./book-results.component.css'],
})
export class BookResultsComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() allBooks: Book[]

  constructor(private libraryService: LibraryService) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {

    this.allBooks = this.libraryService.getBooks()

  }
}
```

# Step 3

### Adding Save and Delete Functions
- We will add a button in the BookResults template under the app-book tag with an html entity for a plus sign and a click event for a method we will add
```html
<button class="float-right" style="border: none; font-size: 16px;" (click)="onSaveBook(bookEl)">&plus;</button>
```

- Now we need to add the method for saving the books on the BookResults Component
```typescript
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Book } from 'src/app/shared/book/book.model';
import { LibraryService } from '../library.service';
import { BookshelfService } from 'src/app/bookshelf/bookshelf.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-book-results',
  templateUrl: './book-results.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./book-results.component.css'],
})
export class BookResultsComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() allBooks: Book[]

  constructor(private libraryService: LibraryService) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.allBooks = this.libraryService.getBooks()
  }

  onSaveBook(book: Book) {
    return this.bookshelfService.saveBook(book)
  }
}

```

- We created the method now we have to connect it to the bookshelf service by injecting it into the component and calling the method saveBook passing book as an argument.

- Next add the BookshelfService method for pushing a book into the myBooks array 
```typescript
   saveBook(book: Book) {
    this.myBooks.push(book);
  }
```

- Now add the button to remove books from your bookshelf in the BookListComponent template
```html
  <button class="float-right" style="border: none; font-size: 16px;" (click)="onRemoveBook(i)">&minus;</button>
```
- Then move the *ngFor to the div that wraps the app-book and the button. Also add a variable for the index

- Now shift to the BookListComponent add the method to remove the book
```typescript
  onRemoveBook(i) {
    this.bookshelfService.removeBook(i);
  }
```

- In the bookshelfService add the removeBook(i){} function
```typescript
  removeBook(i) {
    const index: number = i
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.myBooks.splice(index, 1)
  }
```
