# Services and Dependency Injection

**The Goal:** Add some CRUD functionality to the application using services.

**Services:** 
  1. Library Service
  2. BookshelfService

### Adding the Services

1. Add the service files in the corresponding folders
  1. ex: Library service goes in library folder.
2. Export classes with correct naming conventions.
3. Above the exported class add @Injectable({}) and import it from @angularl/core
4. within the brackets after injectable write:
  1. @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
5. This lets the program know the service is provided in the highest part of the chain.

### Putting Things in the Service

**bookshelfService**
1. copy the myBooks array from the book-list.component.ts and paste it in the the service class.
2. Delete the content within the array in the book-list.component.ts, but keep the array.
3. Import the BookshelfService from its location in the bok-list.component.ts.
4. in the constructor add a reference to the service.
  1. constructor(private bookshelfService: BookshelfService) {}
5. Within the ngOnInIt:
  1. set this.myBooks = this.bookshelfService.getBooks()
6. Show results. It acts the same as it did before.
